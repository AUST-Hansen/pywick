Welcome to Pywick!
========================

About
^^^^^
Pywick is a high-level Pytorch training framework that aims to get you up and running quickly with state of the art neural networks.
Does the world need another Pytorch framework? Probably not. But we started this project when no good frameworks were available and
it just kept growing. So here we are.

Pywick tries to stay on the bleeding edge of research into neural networks. If you just wish to run a vanilla CNN, this is probably
going to be overkill. However, if you want to get lost in the world of neural networks, fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization
for months on end then this is probably the right place for you :)
